                <h2> Malaysian Butter Chicken</h2>
                    <h2 id="author">Posted by <strong>Rachel</strong> on March 9, 2021</h2>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/malay-butter-chicken.jpeg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Malaysian Butter Chicken is a bit crispy, a bit sweet, and a bit spicy. All my friends in Malaysia ate this for lunch whenever they got the chance. </p>
                    <p>Like I said, Butter chicken (or Buttermilk Chicken) was one of my FAVORITE dishes that I had back in Malaysia. However, I found out once I returned home that it actually contains Sweetened Condensed Milk, which I am VERY allergic to. Somehow I didn't have any reaction, but I decided to redo the recipe so that I can actually eat it ;) </p>
                    <p>That being said, I'll also note the ingredients that I am substituting so you can make it the traditional way if you like. </p>
                    <p> So yes, this dish is dairy free, aside from butter (which you can substitute with oil, because we only use it to fry the leaves/garlic in. I would say it tastes quite similar to the real thing, and it tasted like a bit of my Malaysian home. :) Enjoy! </p>

                    <h2>Some notes on Ingredients:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <p>
                            I would say that Curry Leaves have a very unique flavor. If you've tried them before and like them, then add as many as you like! (In these pictures you'll see I used a TON but I would probably use a few less next time. ;) If it's your first time, just add a couple to get your taste buds used to it. I don't know how to describe the flavor. It's really yummy and a bit spicy but if you add too much it can get overpowering. I love adding tons of curry leaves but that's because I've eaten this dish loads of times!
                        </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. If you like chicken breasts, you can totally use that instead and it'll be just as good! </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p> Like I was saying, I am allergic to milk, so I used soymilk here instead of the traditional Sweetened Condensed Milk. To account for this I add a little bit of sugar.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <br>

                    <h1>How to make Malaysian Butter Chicken</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>
                    <p>Prepare 3 bowls, one with your eggs (beaten until smooth), one with the flour, and one with panko. </p>
                    <p>Dice your chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. </p>
                    <p>Using a pair of tongs or your fingers, dip each piece of chicken first in the flour, then the egg wash, then the panko crumbs, and transfer to a plate.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/MalaysianButterChicken/2.jpeg">

                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step">Frying the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p> I just shallow-fried the chicken, so I had to flip the chicken. I also occasionally had to add a bit more coconut oil to the pan. I have a deep fear of deep-frying. I know it's not rational but I have yet to overcome it. </p>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/MalaysianButterChicken/4.jpeg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>For this step, I used coconut oil, but you can use vegetable or canola oil too.  Scoop about 4 heaping tablespoons of coconut oil into the pan, then let it heat up. When it's hot, use tongs (not your fingers this time) to put your pieces of chicken into the oil. Don't overcrowd the pan. Once they're lovely and golden on the bottom, flip them over and repeat until all the chicken is cooked. Place each cooked piece on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb excess oil. If you're worried about whether it's fully cooked, you can also remove a piece from the oil and use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature is >= 165 degrees. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Make the Sauce </span></p>
                    <p>Dice a couple cloves of garlic.</p>
                    <p>  Heat a large pan and add a couple tablespoons of butter. Wash 4-5 curry leaves (or less, or more! I like about 4-5. :) Dry leaves with a paper towel, then add to the butter, along with about a teaspoon of chili flakes and the garlic. Stir frequently and don't let them burn! </p>
                    <p> Once the curry leaves are fragrant and nice, (about 1 minute) add 2 cups of soymilk and turn the heat down to medium-low. If you are using sweetened Condensed milk instead, add that. Stir to combine.</p>
                    <p> If you used soymilk, add about a couple tablespoons of sugar. Continue to stir on low heat.</p>
                   
                    <br>
                    <div>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Add the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p> Add the fried chicken into the sauce and stir until all the chicken is nicely coated. If you feel there isn't enough sauce, you can add a bit more soymilk, and maybe a bit more sugar. Be sure to taste it! I like mine a bit more dry.  </p>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Ta-Da!</span></p>

                    <p>That's it! Serve with rice, and you can garnish with some more of those curry leaves. </p>

                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
                <p>Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as our family and friends do!</p>
