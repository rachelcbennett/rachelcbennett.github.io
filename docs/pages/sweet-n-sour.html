                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/6.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>This Sweet and Sour Chicken is such a quick and easy recipe! I make it on weeknights when I want a treat but I don't have much time.</p>


                    <br>

                    <h1>How to make Sweet 'n Sour Chicken</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>

                    <p>Place your chicken nuggets (or chicken patties, or chicken tenders) onto a baking sheet and bake according to package instructions. If you're using chicken patties or chicken tenders, you might want to get this started a bit earlier because it could take some time. </p>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/1.jpg">
                    </div>

                    <p> Chop the bell pepper (I'm using several baby peppers here) into bite-sized chunks. If you want to add onion (we're not huge fans in this house) then chop that up too. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/2.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p> Heat a medium-sized pan to high heat, then add coconut oil (or any type) once it's hot. Once the oil is sufficiently heated, try tossing in a pepper or two. If it sizzles, it's ready, so throw all the veg in! </p>
                    <p> Now  DON'T STIR IT YET.  However, you'll want to watch the peppers carefully to make sure they don't burn. After a minute or two, flip one over. If it has a nice sear mark on it, then start to stir the peppers and onions around and turn down the heat to medium or low. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/4.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p> Once the peppers are cooking on low heat, you can go ahead and cover the pan and start the next step. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/5.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Make the Sweet 'n Sour Sauce </span></p>
                    <p> While the peppers are cooking, open up your can of pineapple. Drain the pineapple juice (but not the pineapples) into a small mixing bowl. Then add in the Ketchup and Soy Sauce. Whisk to combine. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Add the Pineapple</span></p>
                    <p> Check on the peppers! They should be getting pretty soft and yummy. Once they are, you can go ahead and add the pineapple we saved from earlier. Continue to cook on low heat.  </p>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Adding the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p>When the chicken is ready, take it out of the oven and move to a chopping board. Cut it into bite sized chunks.</p> 
                    <p>Toss the chicken in the pot. Now we are ready to turn up the heat to medium or high. Go ahead and stir the pot, but be careful not to stir too vigorously or you could knock all the breading off of the chicken (another plus side of chicken nuggets--they don't lose their breading so easily). </p> 
                    <p>When the pan is heated again, add in your sauce, stirring a bit more vigorously to combine the sauce. It should thicken because of the breading in the chicken. If it's too thin, you can add a teaspoon of cornstarch or tapioca starch, according to package directions.</p> 

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/sweetnsour/5.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Ta-Da!</span></p>
                    <p> That's it! Pretty easy, huh? Serve with warm rice and be ready to wow your family!</p>

                <p> Hello there! I'm Rachel. Welcome to my website! This is where I share my favorite recipes!</p>
                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
                <p>Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as our family and friends do!</p>
