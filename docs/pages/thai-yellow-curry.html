                <h2> Thai Yellow Curry</h2>
                    <h2 id="author">Posted by <strong>Rachel</strong> on March 3, 2021</h2>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/3.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>I LOVE CURRY. Any kind of curry. Thai Curries are some of my favorites, and this yellow one sure doesn't disappoint. It's a little spicy, and you can easily make it REALLY spicy if you want. By using a curry paste, this recipe becomes pretty easy! I'm excited to share it with you.</p>

                    

                    <h2>Some notes on Ingredients:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I find they are more moist and a lot harder to overcook. If you like chicken breasts, you can totally use that instead. Just note the cooking time and be careful to not let it get tough. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p> For coconut milk, I use the CHAO-KOH brand. It's a nice thickness. I have tried tons of other coconut milk brands and they were super watery and my curry ended up kind of like...well, water. Not my favorite. I definitely wouldn't recommend using lite coconut milk. There are other brands out there that will have a nice thickness to them as well, though. </p>
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <p>I use Mae Ploy Thai Yellow Curry Paste, and I absolutely love it. You can find it at most Asian Grocery Stores, but if you don't have one, you can find it online as well. </p>
                        </li>

                    <h1>How to make Thai Yellow Curry</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>
                    <p>Boil water in a pot. Peel and dice potatoes into bite sized pieces. When the water is boiling, toss the potatoes in.  </p>
                    <p>Dice the chicken thighs into bite sized cubes. Season with a bit of salt and a splash of soy sauce. You can let it marinade before-hand for some extra flavor. </p>
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step">Cooking the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p> Heat a medium-sized pan to high heat, then add coconut oil (or any type) once it's hot. Once the oil is sufficiently heated, add the chicken. Don't stir it yet! Give it a chance to cook. This will result in nice brown sear mark on each piece (if your pot is hot enough and chicken was thoroughly defrosted), which adds a ton of flavor. </p>
                    <p>Once the chicken sears, stir it occasionally, until it's cooked through but not overcooked. Set chicken aside in a separate bowl. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/6.jpg">
                    </div>
                   
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Cook the Carrots </span></p>
                    <p>  In the same pan, add a bit more oil and let it heat up. Then add about a half-cup of carrot match-sticks, as well as about a tablespoon of the curry paste (add more if you like it really spicy). Stir to combine until the carrots are softened. </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>  Add the chicken back in, and stir to combine. Add the can of coconut milk, stirring well and turning the heat down to let it simmer. Add the potatoes. </p>
                    <br>


                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/2.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Add tomatoes</span></p>
                    <p> Add the diced tomato. Taste the curry and add salt as needed. </p>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Ta-Da!</span></p>


                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Pretty easy! This is definitely one of the easiest curries I've made. Serve with warm rice.</p>

                        <li>2 Large Potatoes</li>
                        <li>2 Tbsps Soy Sauce</li>
                        <li>1 Tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
                        <li>1/2 Onion (optional, again, not really fans in this household)</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup Carrot match-sticks</li>
                        <li>1-2 Tbsps Mae Ploy Yellow Curry Paste</li>
                        <li>1 13.5oz can of Coconut Milk </li>
                        <li>1 Roma Tomato, diced (Canned is great too, just use a couple tablespoons)</li>
                        
                    </ul></p>
                        <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Clean, peel, and dice potatoes.</p> </li>
                            <li><p>Boil water. When water is boiling, toss potatoes in.</p> </li>
                            <li><p>Chop chicken into bite sized pieces. Season with soysauce and salt (optional). Chop onions, if desired.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Heat oil in a large skillet. When oil is sufficiently hot, throw chicken in. Resist the urge to stir chicken until they've had a chance to sear (1-2 minutes) then stir and add salt, to taste.</p></li>
                            <li><p>When chicken is cooked, remove and place in a separate bowl. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Add a bit more coconut (or vegetable) oil to the pan, then add the carrot matchsticks and onions. </li>
                            <li><p>Add the Mae Ploy curry paste.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Stir and let cook until the spices are fragrant and the carrots are soft, then add the chicken back in. </li>
                            <li><p>Add the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Turn heat to low. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Check to see if potatoes are soft. Add potatoes to the curry as well as tomatoes.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Taste the curry, if it is too spicy, add a bit more coconut milk (or almond, regular, soy, etc) to cool it down. You can also add more salt, or even more curry paste at this point if you like it spicier. </p></li>
                        </ol>

                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
