                    <br>
                    <p>Singapore Rice Noodles, despite the name, actually originated in Hong Kong, where my mom grew up! I never saw any Singapore Rice Noodles while I was in Singapore. I did see some great Indonesian BBQ, but that's a subject for another time.</p>
                    <p>These noodles are a family favorite! When Covid-19 hit, we started eating them once a week on Saturday's to cheer ourselves up, along with a big plate of fried rice and orange chicken. Now I'm hungry.</p>
                    <p>These rice noodles are spicy, flavorful, and colorful. My mom spent years perfecting this recipe, and now I am going to share it with you! </p>
                    <p>For this recipe you'll want to make sure you've picked up some of that [CURRY PASTE]. It adds the spiciness and great flavor! You'll also want to make sure you pick up some rice noodles. I've included a picture below. Don't be like me and pick up mung bean noodles! I did that and when I was asking my mom over skype how long I should soak them for she told me I was about to make some great Korean Jap Chae! <strong> facepalm</strong></p>


                    <br>

                    <h1>How to make Singapore Rice Noodles</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>
                    <p> For starters you'll want to get a pretty large pan, and one where you feel like you can get in with either two pairs of chopsticks or two sets of tongs, because we will need to toss the noodles later on. </p>
                    <p> Boil some water in a large pan. We'll use this to cook the noodles later as well. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step">Prepare the Eggs</span></p>
                    <p>Beat 3-4 eggs in a bowl until smooth. Heat a separate pan and add a bit of oil. Add the eggs, and then cook them into a round omelete. Remove from the pan, and slice into thin strips.</p>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Cook the Zucchini and Turkey/Ham </span></p>
                    <p> Heat your pan on medium to high heat. Spray your large pan and add a tablespoon of oil or so. I use coconut oil because it's healthy and makes me feel great!</p>
                    <p> When the oil is heated sufficiently, dump in your sliced zucchini and ham/turkey strips! They will start to make a lovely sizzle. </p>
                    <p> After they've had a chance to cook a bit (about 1-2 minutes), season with a bit of salt and pepper.  When they have a lovely brown color on the edges, go ahead and dump them into a separate bowl. We will be adding them back in later.  </p>
                    

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Soak the Noodles</span></p>
                    <p>Soak the noodles with the boiling water in a large bowl. Add about 2 cups of room-temperature water, because we do not want the noodles to cook too quickly. Let it sit for a few minutes, checking the noodles for consistency. You want them to be softened, but not mushy at all. It is very possible to overcook these. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Cook the Carrots and Curry Paste</span></p>
                    <p> Now that the zucchini and noodles are taken care of, add a bit more oil into your pan. Turn stove to medium heat. When it's heated, add the carrot match-sticks. As they're cooking, add 1-2 Tbsps of the Mae Ploy Curry paste. If you like it spicy, feel free to add more. </p>
                    <img src="/images/singapore_blog_img/carrots.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Add Coconut Milk to the Carrots</span></p>
                    <p> After the carrots have softened, add about 1/3 cup of coconut cream/milk. Stir to combine with the carrots and curry paste.</p>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Drain and Add the Noodles</span></p>
                    <p> Now that the noodles are softened, drain them in a strainer and add them to your pot. Using two pairs of tongs, two pairs of chopsticks, or some combination, begin to toss the noodles in the curry/carrot mixture. Continue to do this until all the noodles have picked up that beautiful yellow color and seem well combined. </p>
                    <p>Add the 2 teaspoons or so of curry powder, as well as some salt, to taste.</p>
                    <p>Add the Zucchini/Meat mixture, and continue to toss. Then you can add the sliced eggs. </p>

                    <p><span class = "recipe_step">Ta-Da!</span></p>
                    <p> They're ready to eat! Serve with some orange chicken, some fried rice, or any other kind of yummy dish you like.</p>

                    <h2>Singapore Rice Noodles Recipe</h2>
                    <h2 id="author">By Rach's Recipes</h2>
                    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3-4 eggs</li>
                        <li>1/2 Onion (If desired. We're not huge fans in this house.)</li>
                        <li>1 cup of carrot match-sticks</li>
                        <li>1-2 Tbsps Curry Paste (You can add more if you like it more spicy!)</li>
                        <li>2 Tsp Curry Paste (Again, you can add more if you like it hot!)</li>
                        <li>1/3 Cup of Coconut Milk</li>
                        <li>1 Pkg of Rice Noodles (We like Chao Ching Rice Sticks, which you can find at any Asian grocery store)
                        <li>1 Tsp Salt (or to taste)</li>
                        <li>4-5 slices of ham or turkey deli meat</li>
                        
                    </ul></p>
                
                        <h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Boil water in a large pot.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Cut Zucchini and Ham/Turkey into thin strips. For the Zucchini, you can even use a peeler to get really thin strips, if you like.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Beat eggs. In a separate pan, cook the eggs into a flat pancake/omelete. Remoe from pan, and cut into thin strips.</p></li>
                            <li><p>In a larger pan, add a bit of oil and fry the zucchini and meat. Add a touch of salt. When it has a bit of color to it, remove from the pan into a separate bowl.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Add boiling water to the noodles in a large mixing bowl. Also add 1-2 Cups of room-temperature water, so it doesn't overcook. Check them periodically for softness.</p></li>
                            <li><p>While that soaks, add bit more oil to your pan and begin to cook the carrot match-sticks. Add in the 1-2 Tbsps of Curry Paste and fry for a minute or so, then add 1/3 cup of coconut milk.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Check the noodles. They should be somewhat soft and limp, but not mushy. Don't let them overcook! Once they're ready, transfer them to a colander.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Add your noodles into your coconut/curry/carrot mixture, and toss with tongs, spatula, or chopsticks.</p></li>
                            <li><p>When the noodles are all evenly coated, add in curry powder, if desired, and salt.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Add the zucchini/meat and the eggs. Toss well to combine.</li>
                        </ol>

                <p> Hello there! I'm Rachel. Welcome to my website! This is where I share my favorite recipes!</p>
                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
                <p>Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as our family and friends do!</p>
