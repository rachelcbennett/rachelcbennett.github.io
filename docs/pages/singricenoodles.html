                    <br>
                    <p>Singapore Rice Noodles, despite the name, actually originated in Hong Kong, where my mom grew up! I never saw any Singapore Rice Noodles while I was in Singapore. I did see some great Indonesian BBQ, but that's a subject for another time.</p>
                    <p>These noodles are a family favorite! When Covid-19 hit, we started eating them once a week on Saturday's to cheer ourselves up, along with a big plate of fried rice and orange chicken. Now I'm hungry.</p>
                    <p>These rice noodles are spicy, flavorful, and colorful. My mom spent years perfecting this recipe, and now I am going to share it with you! </p>
                    <p>For this recipe you'll want to make sure you've picked up some of that [CURRY PASTE]. It adds the spiciness and great flavor! You'll also want to make sure you pick up some rice noodles. I've included a picture below. Don't be like me and pick up mung bean noodles! I did that and when I was asking my mom over skype how long I should soak them for she told me I was about to make some great Korean Jap Chae! <strong> facepalm</strong></p>


                    <br>

                    <h1>How to make Singapore Rice Noodles</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>
                    <p> For starters you'll want to get a pretty large pan, and one where you feel like you can get in with either two pairs of chopsticks or two sets of tongs! We will need to toss the noodles later on!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Cook the Zucchini and Turkey/Ham </span></p>
                    <p> Heat your pan on medium to high heat. Spray your large pan and add a tablespoon of oil or so. I use coconut oil because it's healthy and makes me feel great!</p>
                    <p> When the oil is heated sufficiently, dump in your sliced zucchini and ham/turkey strips! They will start to make a lovely sizzle. </p>
                    <p> After they've had a chance to cook a bit (about 1-2 minutes), season with a bit of salt and pepper.  When they have a lovely brown color on the edges, go ahead and dump them into a separate bowl. We will be adding them back in later.  </p>

                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Cook the Carrots and Curry Paste</span></p>
                    <p> Now that the zucchini and meat is taken care of, add a bit more oil into your pan. Turn stove to medium heat. When it's heated, add the carrot match-sticks. As they're cooking, add 1-2 Tbsps of the Mae Ploy Curry paste. If you like it spicy, feel free to add more. </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> After the carrots have softened, add about 1/4 cup of coconut cream/milk. Stir to combine with the carrots and curry paste.</p>

                <p> Hello there! I'm Rachel. Welcome to my website! This is where I share my favorite recipes!</p>
                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
                <p>Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as our family and friends do!</p>
