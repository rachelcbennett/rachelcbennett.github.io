                <h2> General Tso's Chicken</h2>
                    <h2 id="author">Posted by <strong>Rachel</strong> on March 16, 2021</h2>
                    <br>
                    <div>

                    <br>
                    <p>I don't know who General Tso is, and I don't even think this dish is really Chinese... But it's DELICIOUS and so I'm going to share it with you! This is quickly becoming my husband's favorite dish.  It's pretty easy, once you get the hang of breading the chicken, etc. For this recipe, we'll be BAKING the chicken instead of deep frying, so it's just that much healthier!  </p>

                    <h2>Some notes on Ingredients/Methods:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> If you've been reading my other recipes, it probably won't surprise you that I'm using chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. #TeamChickenThigh (please don't actually use that hashtag...) </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p> Panko bread crumbs are the best! They're so easy to use! I get them at the Chinese Market, but you should be able to find them most places.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> I am baking the chicken rather than frying it to make it a little healthier. You can choose to fry it if you like, but the panko really makes a nice texture and I don't even miss the frying.  </p>
                         </li>

                    <h1>How to make General Tso's Chicken</h1> 
                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Getting Started </span></p>
                    <p> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>Line a large baking sheet with tin foil and then spray with cooking spray (I usually use coconut oil) </p>
                    <p> Dice your chicken thighs into bite sized pieces, and get rid of any excess water with a paper towel.  </p>
                    <p>Put the flour, panko crumbs, and 3 eggs into three separate bowls. Beat the eggs thoroughly and add a pinch of salt. </p>

                    
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step">Breading the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p> There are a couple different ways you can do this. I personally use a pair of tongs to grab a piece of chicken, dunk it in the flour, then the egg, and then the breadcrumbs. I think it's a lot faster, and you avoid breading your fingers (usually it gets to the point where I'm like, should I fry these too?) But it's up to you! This will take some time but the tongs speed it up and you'll get faster! </p>
                    <p>Once you finish, the oven should be ready, so pop them in! Set a timer for 20 minutes.  </p>

                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/6.jpg">
                    </div>
                   
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Making the Sauce</span></p>
                    <p>  In the meantime, chop up 2 cloves of garlic.  </p>
                    <p> In a small bowl, combine 3/4 cup of Hoisin Sauce and 1/4 cup of Soy Sauce (I usually use lite soy sauce, less sodium). Add a squirt of Sriracha sauce if you have it, but it's not necessary. Whisk together. </p>
                    <p>Heat a large pan on the stove on medium heat. When the pan is hot, add coconut oil/butter/oil. When the oil is heated, add the garlic and 1 tsp of chili flakes, stirring thoroughly to avoid letting the garlic burn. Once it is nice and yummy smelling, add your sauce! Turn the heat down and let it simmer a bit. </p>
                    <div>
                        <img  class = "sing-rice-pic" src="/images/thaiyellowcurry/1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>  Add the chicken back in, and stir to combine. Add the can of coconut milk, stirring well and turning the heat down to let it simmer. Add the potatoes. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Add the Chicken</span></p>
                    <p>Check the chicken. If it's just beginning to get a beautiful brown color on the top, it should be ready. But you can also check it with a meat thermometer that its internal temperature is at or above 165 degrees.</p>
                    <p>Remove chicken from the oven, and use a spatula or similar tool to remove chicken from the foil. If you oiled it thoroughly it shouldn't stick very much.</p>
                    <p>Turn the heat to low. Dump the chicken in your pot with the sauce, and quickly stir it to combine. The panko will quickly start to absorb the sauce, so don't dilly dally. </p>
                    <p>If after stirring to combine, there are still pieces with little sauce, go ahead and just add a bit more hoisin sauce into the pan and stir thoroughly, and a bit more soy sauce. It's hard to predict how much sauce you'll need because of the breading, but don't fret too much, it always works out. </p>

                   
                    <p><span class = "recipe_step"> Ta-Da!</span></p>
                    <p> That's pretty much it! Dish up the chicken, and add a ton of sesame seeds if you have them for a beautiful look. Serve with rice. I always put some extra chili flakes on the table because some people like it extra spicy!</p>

                <p> Hello there! I'm Rachel. Welcome to my website! This is where I share my favorite recipes!</p>
                <p> You'll notice there is a lot of Asian food on this site. That's because I'm half Chinese and I lived in Malaysia for two years, so I love those flavors. But I also love to branch out!</p>
                <p>Thanks again for visiting, and I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as our family and friends do!</p>
